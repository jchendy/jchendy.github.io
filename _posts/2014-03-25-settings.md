title: Don't give me options
---

Joel Spolsky's [second rule of user interface design](http://www.joelonsoftware.com/uibook/fog0000000249.html) is "every time you provide an option, you're asking the user to make a decision." He argues that designers typically give options to users when they're too lazy or scared to make a choice. He says it's particularly bad to give people options they don't care about.

Here's a full screen of options that I don't care about:

This was on the fancy touchscreen on my flight back to New York yesterday. It's a UI that I'll probably never see again. Why would I want to think about whether I prefer carousels or thumbnails? Will the presence or absence of home menu animations make my flight better?

Et cetera, et cetera.
