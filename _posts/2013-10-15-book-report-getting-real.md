I found this book to be excellent. It's a collection of many clear and concise pieces of advice for managing the product lifecycle. All of the lessons tie back to the key theme: less. From the introduction: "less means: less features, less options/preferences, less people and corporate structure, less meetings and abstractions, less promises"

My key takeaways:

- When a feature request comes in, default to saying no. This is one of the key components of less features. You should keep your focus on making the core features great and driving the product toward your vision. After the idea comes up two or three separate times, it might be worth considering. At that point, you should give the feature a chance to prove itself.
- Relatedly, don't track feature requests. You should be talking to your users enough that you'll hear the important requests over and over again; it will be impossible to forget them. If you have hundreds of requests in your issue tracker, there's no good way to manage them anyway, so don't bother pretending.
- Go straight from sketches to HTML mockups. We've been learning this at work, but it's good to see other people suggesting the same thing. Anything between sketches and HTML doesn't offer a good enough balance of clarity and rapidness to be worth it.

And some repeats of the usual advice:

- The best way to have use empathy is to build products you'll use yourself
- Have a clear and well-communicated vision
- Sketches and prototypes are much better than specs
- Start every feature as an MVP
