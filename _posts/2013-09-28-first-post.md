Welcome to my website. Presumably nobody's going to be reading this, so I'm just writing to myself right now. I set this up using [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) to assemble the content and [Disqus](http://disqus.com/) to handle comments. Both are proving quite easy to use.

Now I just need to figure out where to host it. S3? Github pages? Hmmm...
