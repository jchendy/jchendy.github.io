title: UX is dying, long live product management
---

It's time for UX to end. Seriously. 

Practicing UX was my dream for over seven years. After finishing my HCI studies, I spent the first two years of my career convincing my company to start a UX team, which happened this summer. I believe that user-centered design thinking and the people who understand it are uniquely positioned to bring us amazing products and services beyond what we can imagine right now. But in order for that happen, UX has to die.

I just came from a talk presented by [Lis Hubert](http://www.elisabethhubert.com/) called "The future of UX: killing the wireframe machine", which was presented at the [New York chapter](http://www.ixda.org/local/new-york-ixda) of the [Interaction Design Association](http://www.ixda.org/). This isn't what she set out to do, but Lis convinced me that it's time for the end of UX.

The talk was amazing. I agree with everything she said. But I think she ended just slightly too early and didn't make what I believe to be the obvious conclusion to her arguments. I would have added a few words to her conclusion and changed the title to "The future of UX: killing UX"

Hopefully slides and video of the talk will go online soon. In the mean time, I'll attempt to summarize:

>UX practitioners have a skillset that allows them to deliver clear monetary value to clients by helping them figure out what users need.

I definitely agree with that.

>The most tangible output of UX work is wireframes. 

Sure.

>Because UX people deliver wireframes as their final output, clients start associating UX with wireframes. Clients don't see or understand the full design process; they often just see the wireframes. Thus, they start deprioritizng and defunding everything other than wireframes. The UX people therefore keep delivering wireframes, and the vicious cycle continues, reducing most UX groups to wireframe factories.

Mmm hmm. This is consistent with my experience doing internal UX consulting at work.

>This is bad. By becoming wireframe factories, we're missing out on huge opportunities to add value to businesses.

Yup.

>What we should be doing is "Marrying business needs, user needs, technological capabilities in order to facilitate a human-centered relationship between a customer and one's company" (quote from [an earlier version](http://www.slideshare.net/lishubert/the-future-of-ux-killing-the-wireframe-machine) of the talk)

Absolutely. This is what we've seen with our internal consulting. The clients think they want UI designs, but what they actually need is somebody to make sure they're focused on user and business needs throughout their whole development process.

>There are two things UX practitioners in wireframe factories can do to improve the situation for everybody:
>
>1: Get a real UX job
>
>2: Stop calling your work UX

I am still in whole-hearted agreement.

This is where the talk ended. The rest of the post is my thoughts on what the conclusion should have been.

In the talk, and the discussion afterward, the consensus was that a 'real UX job' means combining user insight, business needs, and technical knowledge to inform what the clients should be building. That should sound familiar. It's pretty much identical to every definition of product management on the web. [1](http://www.mindtheproduct.com/2011/10/what-exactly-is-a-product-manager/) [2](http://umeshunni.com/2012/12/how-to-get-that-next-product-manager-job-at-google-etc/) [3] (https://medium.com/what-i-learned-building/63c09a43d0ec) [4](http://www.sachinrekhi.com/blog/2013/01/28/what-is-product-management)

I believe that the future of UX ('real UX' according to Lis) is product management. Looking at the literature for UX and product management, it's clear that both disciplines are trying to accomplish the same thing: make businesses  more profitable by helping them understand what they should be building. And both disciplines recognize that the key components of this are understanding users, understanding the business, and understanding the technology. The biggest difference is how companies view the roles: UX is a wireframe factory, and product is trusted to figure out what to build. 

People who are able to really understand what users need can clearly deliver more value in a product management position than a wireframe factory. So instead of trying to redefine UX to have more of an impact, UX designers who focus on users and business can keep using those skills while calling themselves PMs, and the ones who like to build wireframes can stay in the wireframe factory and start calling themselves UI designers. That way everybody contributes maximum value to the business, and the term UX is no longer around to confuse people.

Lis's presentation can be modified just slightly to communicate this message:

>There are two things UX practitioners in wireframe factories can do to improve the situation for everybody:
>
>1: Get a real UX job, call yourself a PM
>
>2: Stop calling your work UX, call youself a UI designer
