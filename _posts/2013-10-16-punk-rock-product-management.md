When I picked up my drum sticks and joined [a punk band](http://facebook.com/thestrangetimes) after a several year break, I knew I'd be have an awesome time playing music and meeting new people, but I didn't anticipate that it would also be an excellent chance to practice my job skills.

Many people, [such as Martin Eriksson](http://www.mindtheproduct.com/2011/10/what-exactly-is-a-product-manager/) will tell you that product management is at the intersection of tech, UX, and business.

With my school and work experience, I have a good handle on tech and UX, but I could definitely use some experience with business. Luckily, it turns out that being in an unknown band is basically a business/marketing problem. Our current focus is on how to get more people at our shows. We've got great songs that we all love, and we're having no trouble booking shows (we're doing about 2-4 per month), but the attendance as always disappointing. So we've had several brainstorming sessions to think about how to accomplish this. To me this is a very interesting problem, and I haven't had much experience with it since my products at work so far have all been internal-facing. 

Here are a few of our many ideas:
* Start playing shows where people are already gathered (e.g. house parties)
* Show up in crowded places (e.g. Union Square), play acoustic songs, and hand out fliers
* Get into the youth scene (most of our current shows are in bars)
* Figure out who the bands are that are 1-2 steps ahead of us and try to get onto their shows
* Give people other reasons to come to the shows (e.g. after parties, free food)

We've decided to start by trying to book more all-ages shows and get onto shows with bands just slightly more popular than us. I'm not sure yet how to translate the concepts of MVPs and user testing into the world of music, but hopefully I'll have something interesting to report in the coming weeks and months.
