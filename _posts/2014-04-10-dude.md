title: Dude, where's my car?
---

I got a car about a month ago, and I really wish I had this app. It addresses two problems that I've had in NYC:

* I often have to park multiple blocks from home. I can totally picture myself forgetting where the car is.
* Most blocks are closed to parking one or two days a week for street sweeping, so I have to remember when to move my car.

</div>

I'd guess something like this already exists, but I wanted to go through the exercise of mocking it up before I search the webs.
