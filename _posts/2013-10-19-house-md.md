#Pro

**Brilliant problem solver**

Dr House has demonstrated his excellent critical thinking skills time and time again in triaging, diagnosing, and treating patients. While we've never seen him envision, design, and prioritize software products, it's clear to me that he possesses analytical skills more than sufficient to work through these challenges.

**Excellent user research instincts**

Dr House has proven to be a great user researcher. He has repeatedly shown this by digging deep into his patients lives rather than taking their situations at face value. Rather than simply ask the patient about their situation, he'll ask deeper questions that may at first seem irrelevant, interview family members, and often perform ethnographic research at their workplaces and homes. 

This skill will be extremely valuable in product vision and design. Engineers and others with limited user research experience will often just ask users what they want and build it. While House's mantra 'everybody lies' may be a bit extreme, it is important to realize that users often don't know what they need or don't know how to communicate their needs. You can get much better information by watching them work and designing questions to give you a deeper understanding of the contexts they work in. Dr House will excel at this.

#Con

**Questionable leadership style**

Despite many years of experience as a manager, Dr. House appears to have a lack of empathy for his direct reports and others who are involved in his projects. He is usually able to get what he needs, but this is more often a result of manipulation and coercion rather than motivation and leadership. 

#Recommendation: no hire

While his general brilliance and user research skill would certainly result in great ideas, Dr. House's style of dealing with people would be harmful to the overall health of an organization. He may be able to produce great short term results, but over the long term, people working with him would experience high levels of stress and burnout.
