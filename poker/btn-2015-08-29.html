<h1>Scenario 1</h1>

<img src="img/2015-08-29/hand1.png">

<h3>Opponents</h3>
<ul>
	<li>HJ is opening fairly wide. 25% RFI on HJ.</li>
	<li>HJ's fold to 3bet of 53% means we can't 3bet bluff with pure air</li>
	<li>SB and BB look to have pretty wide calling ranges and probably play poorly postflop, so we'd be happy to get in with speculative hands</li>
	<li>SB and BB have low 3bet %, so we're not worried about getting squeezed</li>
</ul>

<h3>Strategy</h3>
<p>
3bet a narrow value range so we don't scare away the poor players in the blinds. Call with a wide range that can flop big strength.
</p>

<h1>Scenario 2</h1>

<img src="img/2015-08-29/hand3.png">

<h3>Opponents</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Same opener as scenario 1 in the same position</li>
	<li>SB and BB are much more competent players, not as excited to get in with them postflop</li>
	<li>SB and BB have moderate and high 3bet %</li>
</ul>

<h3>Strategy</h3>
<p>
Widen our 3bet range a bit because SB and BB folding is no longer a problem, and HJ will call fairly wide. Shrink our calling range because we'll be squeezed often.

<h1>Scenario 3</h1>

<img src="img/2015-08-29/hand2.png">

<h3>Opponents</h3>
<ul>
	<li>HJ opening range is tighter, but they look like a bad player, so we're happy to get in with lots of speculative hands.</li>
	<li>HJ's fold to 3bet of 80% (4/5) suggests we can 3bet bluff a lot</li>
	<li>SB has a high 3bet, so calling isn't super attractive for us</li>
</ul>

<h3>Strategy</h3>
<p>
3bet a small value range and big bluff range. Call with a moderate number of speculative hands.
</p>
