<b>SB calling range</b><br />
I'm not sure what to think here. Villain is probably a reg (I'm assuming the VPIP/PFR gap will close with some more hands), but if that's true, why would he flat from SB? I don't think he's actually calling this wide, but this should be a superset of what he's actually calling. I'd be interested to hear thoughts on whether this could be narrowed. <br />

This looks to be one of the best possible flops for a reg's calling range. Cbetting as a bluff would probably be a mistake.<br />

Even though the blank turn seems like a good card to barrel on, SB's flop range was so strong that he's not folding much here. <br />

Another blank. All of villain's draws are worthless now, but he still has a lot of value hands. Probably shouldn't be bluffing here. <br />
